            <h3>What is a System Prompt?</h3>
            <p>A system prompt is a set of instructions and information given to an AI assistant at the start of a conversation. It acts like a specialized knowledge base and a set of guidelines, helping the AI to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Understand the context and domain of the conversation (in this case, Salesforce development)</li>
                <li>Access relevant knowledge and best practices</li>
                <li>Provide more accurate and helpful responses to your queries</li>
                <li>Maintain consistency in its approach and recommendations</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Think of it as giving the AI a crash course in Salesforce development and architecture, making it a more knowledgeable and effective assistant for your Salesforce-related tasks.</p>
